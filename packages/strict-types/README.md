# strict-types

A utility library for strict TypeScript applications. 

In strict mode you commonly have union types for variables which usually consists of `type | undefined |null`,
where `type` is e.g. `string`. 

This library is providing for each primitive data type a strict type:
* `StrictString`
* `StrictNumber`
* `StrictBoolean`
* `StrictArray`
* `StrictObject`
